SCEZ perl5 bindings
-------------------

The usage is very similar to the usage in C (see tpscez.pl).

Important differences are:

- The free the memory of a SC_CARD_INFO and SC_READER_INFO structure
  you can't call scGeneralFreeCard or scGeneralFreeReader because they
  want a pointer to a pointer. (At least I have found no way to do this.)
  You have to call SC_CARD_INFO_free and SC_READER_INFO_free.
